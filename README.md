# My Mini Project Landing Page

This is my first mini project completion.
The project is a landing page for a website that contains contact info, and a way to input your contact information using text boxes.

## Basic Information

This project was done completely from scratch, using the provided landing page template as a basic guide for how it should all look.

I own none of the rights to any of the images used (See "Resources Cited")

I wanted to use a dark theme for the website, as it's my favorite color scheme for all online applications. It's easy on the eyes, and nice and smooth looking.


## Features

As per the Acceptance Criteria, this page contains:

* Semantic HTML elements.

* universal, element, and class selectors in CSS.

* Three colors in the design.

* A single font family for all the text.

* Uses two heading elements.

* Has a header that is fixed to the top of the page when you scroll.

* Header contains a nav bar with three inline links, which includes a contact link.

* When the contact link is clicked, the page jumps directly to the contact form.

* Includes a functioning send button.

* Both images contain descriptive "alt" attributes.

* And if you are reading this, it has been deployed to github and github pages.

## Usage

This is a very easy to use webpage. Below are listed the ways to use anything that you can interact with.

### Quick Links

* Github Profile Link: Click the "Github" text in the top right of the page, to be directed to my github profile.

* Portfolio Link: Click the "Portfolio" text in the top right to be directed to my previous github project.
